A. introduction
B. market survey
- 	recycling printer catridges - only 20-30% recycled globally ([Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354280541_Challenges_and_Emerging_Trends_in_Toner_Waste_Recycling_A_Review))
- 	garage oils - The used vehicle oil is being sold to industries as a replacement for high priced furnace oil and light deisel oil. Without reprocessing, it produces air pollution. Garages drain the used oil in the sewers causing great environmental damage. [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257728896_Spent_Oil_Management_and_its_Recycling_Potential_in_India_Inventory_and_Issues_PROCEDIA_ENVIRONMENTAL_SCIENCES)
- 	Factors that support re-refining as a more sustainable option for used oil management include contributions to local job creation, regional or national energy security and competition in the lubricating oil market by replacing foreign production increasingly with local production
- 	Re-refining used oil into base oil (lubricants without additives) has benefits associated with reducing the need to produce base oil from crude oil sources and avoiding emissions associated with used oil disposal.
- 	The Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling & Trans boundary Movement) Rules, 2008 finalised the processes that produce HW, wherein spent oil (used and waste oil) has been classified as highly polluting (red category).
- 	 Extended Producer Responsibility, have been published by the government of India
- 	 In India, roughly 257 registered spent oil (used/waste oil) recycling facilities are located in 124 districts and 19 states, with a combined capacity of 1.39 MMT.

C. problem statement 
D. proposed solution 
- we are providing a clear and established pathway for the collection and re-processing of unconventional hazardous wastes (like oils, batteries, etc) and creating a streamlined process.

D. future scope 

E. qna session.
- How are we different from kabadi walas?
	- Connects used product of company to company's hired recycling unit.
	- Improve categorization of product 
- There are normal recycling centers? 
	- no. if you google recycling centers near me, then only 3-4 locations spread out turn up. googling is fastest way to communicate, hence we use that to explain our solution.
