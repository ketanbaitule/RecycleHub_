## 2. Market Survey

### 2.1 Recycling Printer Cartridges
- Only 20-30% of printer cartridges are recycled globally. This inefficiency poses a significant challenge to sustainable waste management. [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354280541_Challenges_and_Emerging_Trends_in_Toner_Waste_Recycling_A_Review)

### 2.2 Garage Oils
- The used vehicle oil is being sold to industries as a replacement for high-priced furnace oil, causing air pollution. Garages draining used oil into sewers also contribute to environmental damage. [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257728896_Spent_Oil_Management_and_its_Recycling_Potential_in_India_Inventory_and_Issues_PROCEDIA_ENVIRONMENTAL_SCIENCES)

### 2.3 Used Oil Management in India
- Factors supporting re-refining as a sustainable option for used oil management, including job creation, energy security, and local production. The Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 classify spent oil as highly polluting. Extended Producer Responsibility guidelines by the government of India. Approximately 257 registered spent oil recycling facilities in India. [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340427712_Current_state_of_e-waste_management_in_India)

### 2.4 e-Waste in India
- An overview of the current state of e-waste management in India. [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340427712_Current_state_of_e-waste_management_in_India)

## 3. Problem Statement

The current state of hazardous waste management poses several challenges, including inadequate recycling of printer cartridges, improper disposal of garage oils, and the need for a more efficient system to manage used oil in India. The Hazardous Wastes Rules classify spent oil as highly polluting, highlighting the urgency for an effective solution.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution

We propose a comprehensive solution that establishes a clear pathway for the collection and re-processing of unconventional hazardous wastes. This includes oils, batteries, and other materials, creating a streamlined process to ensure proper disposal and recycling. The system aims to bridge the gap in existing waste management infrastructure and promote a more sustainable approach.

---

## 5. Future Scope

The Hazardous Waste Management System has vast potential for future enhancements and expansions. Potential areas of growth include incorporating new types of hazardous waste, expanding the network of recycling facilities, and integrating advanced technologies for more efficient waste tracking and management.

## 6. Q&A Session

### 6.1 How are we different from kabadi walas?
- Our system connects used products directly to the company's designated recycling units, ensuring a more structured and accountable recycling process.
- Improving categorization of products allows for a more precise and effective recycling approach.

### 6.2 Are there normal recycling centers?
- No, there are limited recycling centers available. A quick Google search for "recycling centers near me" typically yields only 3-4 locations, spread out across the region. Our solution utilizes the speed and convenience of online communication to address this scarcity.
